Regardless on the opinion around using a sleep method, it is nice to have a sleep helper method in JS.\n\nIf you're interested in having a sleep utility method, here is how you can do it:\n\n<iframe height=\"560\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Javascript Sleep Method\" src=\"https://codepen.io/iamjpg/embed/eYvqaRX?defaultTab=js&theme-id=dark\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\">\n  See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/iamjpg/pen/eYvqaRX\">\n  Javascript Sleep Method</a> by J.P. Given (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/iamjpg\">@iamjpg</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n\nThere are couple of things to note about this implementation.\n\nFirst, notice that the method uses `async/await`. So to use the sleep method it needs to be inside an `async` function and you must `await` the sleep() method.\n\nThat's about it. A one liner and nice little utility.","createdAt":"2021-06-16T20:38:35.383511+00:00","date":"2021-06-16","tags":["javascript"],"author":{"name":"JP","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/iP3Rb3SSXCyyvmxfFsex"}},"twitterPost":null,"youTubeVideoId":null}},
