I came across Kent's YouTube page about a year and a half ago because I subscribe to [Alip Bata](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlipBaTa_Djancuki) and [Luca Stricagnoli](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnXQJu45EMrCKBxvk5Sicpg) (amongst others).\n\nMy introduction to him was his arrangement of [Prince's \"Purple Rain\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx4wz55J0Qg) and it blew my mind. It's complicated and yet simple. It wasn't overdone but the attention to detail to the original song is flawless.\n\nThen I watched his arrangement of [Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJD77tJ1BEw) and it was over for me. First, he pulls off the solo while maintaining the bass-line on his six-string. Truly incredible. The best part though was he posted the tabs for his arrangement like any of us mortals could play it. Thanks, Kent.\n\nIn his latest video, [Michael Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk24x1x3YI), the execution of harmonics while strumming is incredible.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is he's so damn technical he makes the difficult look simple which is a testament to his skill.\n\nAbove is his arrangement of [Michael McDonald's \"I Keep Forgettin'\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFAv8G_A9Cs) because it's a dope song and it shows Kent having a little fun while playing.\n\nAlip and Luca are incredible yet there's something so pure in Kent's arrangements. They're never overdone or attempting to showoff. They're always an homage to the original work which is why I enjoy his playing so much.","createdAt":"2022-04-29T15:48:23.859049+00:00","date":"2022-04-29","tags":["guitar"],"author":{"name":"JP","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/iP3Rb3SSXCyyvmxfFsex"}},"twitterPost":null,"youTubeVideoId":"LFAv8G_A9Cs"}},
