Web servers are incredibly good at serving HTML, CSS & Javascript. The ability to build a static website off of dynamic data is a fun paradigm. Once deployed there's no SSR, no database calls, no server side computation - just HTML, CSS, JS, and assets served over the wire. The result is a blazing fast site right out of the box.\n\nWhile this site is fairly simple the lighthouse scores are strong. Performance is only dinged because the programming quotes cause a slight content shift. I don't think that's too big a deal. Accessibility on the other hand, I will circle back and fix what's missing.\n\n![lighthouse.png](https://media.graphcms.com/53q1fsgRQVyMLi7dUXgb)\n\nI'll have to remember to do a more detailed writeup of my overall experience but my initial thoughts are very positive.\n\n### Update: June 11th, 2021\n\nSo the performance hit was actually due to Google Fonts causing the content shift. I switched them out for native font-families (Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif && Georgia, serif) and now my performance score is 100%. Woot.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-06-11 at 9.53.16 AM.png](https://media.graphcms.com/6XEGz0hSYS8qAVebBzKg)","createdAt":"2021-06-04T23:04:04.77124+00:00","date":"2021-06-04","tags":["hello world"],"author":{"name":"JP","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/iP3Rb3SSXCyyvmxfFsex"}},"twitterPost":null,"youTubeVideoId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
