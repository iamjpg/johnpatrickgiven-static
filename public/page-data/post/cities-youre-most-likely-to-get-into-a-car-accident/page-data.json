When my wife and I moved to Las Vegas from Seattle in 2019 I sold all three of my motorcycles. Why? Because drivers in Las Vegas scared the shit out of me every time I&#39;d be in Las Vegas visiting my wife&#39;s family.</p></div><p></p><p>It&#39;s a regular thing for a car to fly 4 lanes across I-15 or the 215 to not miss an exit. What I described is literally the thing I fear most when riding a bike - stupid ass maneuvers like that.</p><p></p><p>I rode my motorcycles in Seattle all year long. In all weather (except snow and ice) and never had a problem. Rain is no big deal when you ride enough. Hills are no problem either - just be a little more careful going downhill on rainy days.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, when I first found this infographic I expected Seattle to be on the list. And Las Vegas - only I thought they would be much higher.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this infographic shows me that I&#39;m incorrect around my fears riding a motorcycle in this city. North Las Vegas is only slightly worse than Seattle (9 100ths of a point) and where I live, Paradise, was #50 on the list. Below Seattle.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, I found it interesting and hope you might too. Turns out the main place to not drive a car or ride a motorcycle is in the DC/Baltimore area. Noted</p>"},"createdAt":"2021-06-09T23:52:51.433483+00:00","date":"2021-06-09","tags":["driving","motorcycles","infographic"],"author":{"name":"JP","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphcms.com/iP3Rb3SSXCyyvmxfFsex"}},"twitterPost":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
