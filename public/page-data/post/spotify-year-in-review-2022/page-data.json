I listen to music on Spotify a lot. It's by far my most used paid for service. Because of that you'd think I'd have a better idea of what my artist rankings would be going in - but every single year at least two are surprising. \n\nThis year, it was my #1 and #2 I didn't see coming.\n\nI LOVE Frank Turner and Ryan Adams but I honestly didn't think I listened to them more than anyone else. I can't help but wonder how much of that is Spotify putting their music in their dynamically made playlists. Regardless, I didn't see that one coming.\n\nThe Bronx is my favorite band of all time so them being in my top 5 is a constant. Forever.\n\nAmos Lee is a mellow goto for me. My wife and I would play him regularly when cooking dinner or winding down after work. Welcome to my top5, my dude.\n\nAnd finally Slomosa. Easily my favorite band I listened to for the first time this year (Thanks, Mike!). Their self titled album came out in 2020 but I was late to the party. Better late than ever - they're awesome.\n\nAs always, wonderful stuff from Spotify.","createdAt":"2022-12-02T19:10:37.288499+00:00","date":"2022-12-02","tags":[],"author":{"name":"JP","picture":{"url":"https://media.graphassets.com/iP3Rb3SSXCyyvmxfFsex"}},"twitterPost":null,"youTubeVideoId":null}},
